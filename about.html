I am currently seeking an internship position as a Front End Web Developer.I want to work in a growing environment where everyone is passionate about his/her work , and where I can put my skills to use, and learn more from people around me. I have previously had a little exposure to working with a web based startup. My skillset include HTML, CSS, javaScript, jQuery(just getting started to leaen it), Java, Wordpress, Photoshop, Android application development. Apart from playing around with computers, I like to sketch, and I used to be an avid blog writer (couldn't continue it due to increased school work). <br>
